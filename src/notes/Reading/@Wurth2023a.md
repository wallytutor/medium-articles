- PINNs are alternative to SBO methods

- Reference 6: one NN per output

- Used same weight for all losses (domain, B.C., I.C.)

- NNs provide automatic jacobian and hessian evaluations, what can be used for great benefit of optimization algorithms

- Implemented in SciANN [[@Haghighat2021sciann]] (wrapper to [[@Tensorflow2015Whitepaper]])

- Solves the [diffusion equation](../Transport-Phenomena/Diffusion-Equation)

- Interesting to write a tutorial about!
