In this post, the author discusses the work by [[@Wu2022a]] in what concerns the adaptive (resampling and refinement) residual point distribution to boost training and accuracy.

Approaches:
- **RAD:** residual-based adaptive distribution (more expensive)
- **RAR-D:** residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (robust)
- Both are less useful under smooth solutions (activate when required)

**Key idea:**  resample with a probability proportional to residual

$$
p(x) \propto \frac{\varepsilon^k(x)}{𝔼[\varepsilon^k(x)]}+C
$$
