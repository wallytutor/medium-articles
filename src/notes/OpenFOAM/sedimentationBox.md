The goal of this study is to verify the role of some drag models over particle drop dynamics. Other than the drag models, particle size and role of parameter `applyGravity` in implicit packing model. The later was added because of unexpected results found in some cases of [horizontalMixer](horizontalMixer.md) and [dustCollector](dustCollector).

## Analytical solution
