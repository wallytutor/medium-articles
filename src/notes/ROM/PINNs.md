Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) were first introduced by [[@Raissi2017]] in the context of providing data-driven solutions of nonlinear PDE's. In what follows we review the basic concepts and approaches developed in this field during the past few years. Both mathematical and application aspects will be treated in the review.
## Common applications

 As per [[@Guo2024a]] the following common applications arise from PINNs:
 
- Predictive modeling and simulations
	- Solution of dynamical systems (even high-dimensional)
	- Acceleration of multi-physics simulations

- Optimization and systems control
	- Surrogate models for design optimization
	- Inverse design (finding conditions)
	- Model predictive control
	- Optimal sensor placement
	
- Data-driven insights

- Data-driven enhancement

- Monitoring, diagnostic, and health assessment

## Key Ideas

- *Inject* the prediction values in the governing equations to compose the loss function, enforcing the NN to *obey* the underlying physics.

- There are 2 components in the loss function, the *physical loss* evaluated from the deviation from training data (as is commonplace in NN training) and the PDE loss, which is further divided into *boundary* and *initial condition* losses.

- **Collocation points** is how we call the temporal and spacial coordinates where evaluation of physical properties are computed, corresponding to nodes or cell centers in classical numerical schemes.

## Research opportunities

- Following [[@Guo2023a]] citing the work by [[@Wu2022a]], resampling and refinement methods could be improved by better PDF's and the use of active or reinforcement learning to improve sampling.
