## Common applications

- Predictive modeling and simulations
- Optimization
- Data-driven insights
- Data-driven enhancement
- Monitoring, diagnostic, and health assessment

## Key Ideas

- *Inject* the prediction values in the governing equations to compose the loss function, enforcing the NN to *obey* the underlying physics.

- There are 2 components in the loss function, the *physical loss* evaluated from the deviation from training data (as is commonplace in NN training) and the PDE loss, which is further divided into *boundary* and *initial condition* losses.

- **Collocation points** is how we call the temporal and spacial coordinates where evaluation of physical properties are computed, corresponding to nodes or cell centers in classical numerical schemes.
