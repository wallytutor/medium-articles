Notes based on *Data-Driven Science and Engineering* by Steven L. Brunton and J. Nathan Kurz. Their proposed teaching materials for the book can be found [here](https://www.databookuw.com/page-6/page-14/). Supplementary notes that might be useful for understanding the concepts are provided in course [AMATH301](https://www.youtube.com/@amath3019/videos). The set of open source materials proposed by Kurz's team is found [here](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/page5/page23/).
