# Approximating functions

In this article we will explore how least squares work and implement an
arbitrary function fitting in Julia. The approach implemented here follows the
works of [Professor Dr. Hans Peter Langtangen
(deceased)](https://hplgit.github.io/fem-book/doc/web/index.html) who have
written probably the best introductory texts on finite element methods to date.
