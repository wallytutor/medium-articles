# Transport Phenomena

In this course we provide a Julia relecture to the famous [The 12 steps to
Navier-Stokes equations](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00021), by
Lorena A. Barba and Gilbert F. Forsyth. It is not a bare translation, but a
different approach to the problems with the addition of new elements. The final
goal must be seen not only as reaching the implementation of Navier-Stokes
equations, but learning the key ideas of finite differences before learning more
advanced and general numerical methods. Students who are undergoing Calculus
training should already meet the minimum requirements to follow this course.

Focus will be given not only on the numerical methods, but also how a computer
implementation should look like. This last point is the most distinctive point
from the work upon which it is based. A vast amount of learning resources is
available for scientific computing, but rare sources really provide guidance for
conceiving quality and maintainable code. Here we try to contribute for better
coding practices through a *think-before-coding* approach.
