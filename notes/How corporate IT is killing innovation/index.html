<div class="franklin-content"><p>For the past decade I have constantly worked with innovation. That&#39;s all I know to do with my life. A day without creating is mostly not worth it. Whether it was in academic or corporate settings, I generally got along with teammates and most stakeholders. But no matter where I go I am followed by a constant ghost , the <em>enemy</em>, the corporate IT. I known I don&#39;t fit in, I don&#39;t belong in the system, I don&#39;t fall into the listen-pray-obey-loop-herd, but that is not the reason why I should be guilty of how bad my interactions with corporate IT &#40;not specifically with IT people, I have met very nice people there&#41; have been for more than one decade.</p>
<p>So far, my words might seem harsh and full of anger to the uneager reader. As I scientist I am prompt to expect hateful reactions from the conservatives and religiously aligned corporate people. But as a scientist I shall recur to the reason and argumentation to expose, solely based on observations, my conclusions on the matter. Time to end the vague wording, let&#39;s get to the anecdotes.</p>
<h2 id="installing_a_compiler_but_you_no_admin"><a href="#installing_a_compiler_but_you_no_admin" class="header-anchor">Installing a compiler, but you no admin</a></h2>
<p>Early in my PhD days I was told I should model some chemically reacting flows to better understand some processes I was studying. As usual, you start that by a literature review cause you are told so or because you are not dumb enough to think you can reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>After some reading I realized there was <em>nothing</em> to add to that field under my research scope and it was time to use the <em>numbers</em> that were already available in the literature. <em>Yay, time to code&#33;</em> Well, not so fun... In fact, that <em>nothing-moment</em> is when PhD students realize how humble they have to be in face of existing knowledge. It is also often the point where the <em>cracks</em> appear in the system, the small spots where they can make a small contribution.</p>
<p>My lab was a standard <em>Windows-only</em> environment, although later on I discovered that there were more exceptions than rules in the system. I was actually in the <em>wrong side of the building</em>, most students in the other wing had everything I dreamt of. Since the libraries I was aiming to use at the time were not portable from <em>Nix</em>, I had to start my crusade to show IT I was not <em>the standard user</em> and that I was <em>worth Baloo048</em> &#40;Baloo048 was the name of my workstation once I got authorized a <em>CentOS 5</em> system&#41;&#33;</p>
<h2 id="security_above_obscurity_and_overall"><a href="#security_above_obscurity_and_overall" class="header-anchor">Security above obscurity &#40;and overall&#41;</a></h2>
<p>Here I am not making a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">security through obscurity</a> and I will actually cite several unrelated events that I have seen so far.</p>
<p>IT has always been considered guilty of major failures in security systems. Nonetheless, trespassers often get inside by errors committed by standard network users. Keep that repeating for more than 40 years and you&#39;ve got what we have today: an overprotective <em>IT mother</em>. – <em>You</em> don&#39;t know how to use a computer&#33; <em>You</em> are an irresponsible <em>m-word</em>&#33; – And the list goes on... so a monster was born. All because of repeated wrong root-cause analysis.</p>
<p>With the rise of social networks, machine learning, and everything that dominated the web since 2010, IT gained power in major corporations and in some situations their choices come above technical or commercial ones. Naturally, the overly repressed IT people raised their concerns about every living and digital thing and started locking all paths to standard users.</p>
<p>What companies forgot is how that building walls also block your views to the outside world. Innovation has always been a matter of who copies the best part of what others are doing. Mankind never created a single thing, we copied from nature, and then, putting bricks together, we copied from one another with varying levels of complexity. That to say, every single patent is somehow dishonest. But we keep protecting them, they are the <em>status quo</em> basis of competition. That&#39;s the case probably because we are less intelligent than we think we are.</p>
<p>The <em>moment</em> IT obfuscates the view of technical people, the copy-edit-paste cycle is broken: innovation is, at least, strongly hurt. And there is no lack of examples of how this actually happens.</p>
<p>I will stick to what concerns my technical field of expertise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In numerical simulation it is fundamental to <em>sandbox</em> everything, especially systems. Creativity comes with destruction, it&#39;s always oblivion. Numerical people like hard access to perform their best &#40;and sometimes even to perform at all&#41;. Working with containers or, even worse, the cloud, are nightmarish. In our world a sandbox is nothing more than a good old workstation without company network access. We make magic there. Every single time an engineer has to beat themselves to <em>have the right to work</em> their best, they get damaged. Some withstand for years, some simply get <em>aligned</em>, what is even worse than quiet quitting. <strong>Give us sandboxes to play&#33;</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>In an average corporation &#40;not talking about sizes here&#33;&#41;, there are just a few people working on cutting edge technologies. Sometimes they go beyond the academic state-of-the-art &#40;what is often the situation in semi-conductor industry, for instance&#41;. Because they are a minority, they get statistically forgotten by IT as <em>standard users</em>. Needless to say, these are also the people who <em>know what they are doing with a computer</em>. Based on what I said before, you get that we enter an infinite recursion here: <em>you user no know how to use computer</em>, but <em>me user statistical minority</em>, and so on...</p>
